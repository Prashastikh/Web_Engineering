		<p>“The one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once-by even a glimpse would not give that glimpse for the shows of the rest of the world combined” ~ Mark Twain
		<br>
        Although there are many things to do in the world, but when it comes to traveling there are some places that can’t be missed in a lifetime. This list talks about them</p>
	</div>
	<h3>1. The Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia</h3>
	<div class="container">
      <img src="GreatBarrierreef.jpg" style="position:relative; TOP:5px; LEFT:372px; WIDTH:580px; HEIGHT:300px">
      <div class="text-block1">
      <p>Highlight: Coral Reef</p>
      </div>
    </div>
	<div class = "gamma">
		<br>
		The Great Barrier Reef is the largest collection of coral reefs in the world, spanning over 1,400 miles. It’s so large that it can be seen from space, and it’s among one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World. It is the place to go diving, offering a one-of-a-kind display of underwater life.
	</div>
	<h3>2. Pyramids of Giza, Egypt</h3>
	<div class="container">
       <img src="GreatPyramid.jpg" alt="Nature" style="position:relative; TOP:8px; LEFT:372px; WIDTH:580px; HEIGHT:300px">
       <div class="text-block2">
       <p>Highlight: Pyramids</p>
       </div>
    </div>
	<div class = "gamma">
		<br>
		As the only one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World still largely intact, the Pyramids of Giza are definitely worth a visit. Dating back to around 2,560 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza stood as the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years.
	</div>
	<h3>3. Stonehenge, Amesbury, England</h3>
	<div class="container">
       <img src="Stonehenge.jpg" alt="Nature" style="position:relative; TOP:9px; LEFT:372px; WIDTH:580px; HEIGHT:300px">
       <div class="text-block3">
       <p>Highlight: Standing Stones</p>
       </div>
    </div>
	<div class = "gamma">
		<br>
		Lots of mystery surrounds Stonehenge, and contrary to those who believe it’s just a pile of 25-ton rocks, it’s actually a beautiful sight. Book a guided tour to visit the center, and at sunset, enjoy the stunning glow of the setting sun between Stonehenge’s pillars.	
	</div>
	<h3>4. Salar De Uyuni, Bolivia</h3>
	<div class="container">
       <img src="bolivia.jpg" alt="Nature" style="position:relative; TOP:10px; LEFT:372px; WIDTH:620px; HEIGHT:300px">
       <div class="text-block4">
       <p>Highlight: World's biggest mirror</p>
       </div>
    </div>
	<div class = "gamma">
		<br>
		This massive salt flat–the largest in the world–spans a massive 4,086 square miles. Formed by several ancient lakes, this salt flat becomes so reflective in the rainy season that it’s used to calibrate satellites. It’s effectively the world’s largest mirror and a breathtaking sight.
